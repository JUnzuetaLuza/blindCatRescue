          <h2>Welcome to the official web page for Blind Cat Rescue & Sanctuary, Inc</h2>
          <p>We are a lifetime cat care sanctuary located in St. Paulls, North Carolina (USA). In 2005, we build our first building as a safe place for blind cats who were deemed not adoptable by regular shelters and were going to be euthanized because they were blind.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we build a second shelter to provide a safe place for Leukemia positive (FELV+) abd Feline Immunodeficency Virus (FIV+) cats who otherwise would be killed because they tested positive for these viruses.</p>
          <p>We are a registered non-profit 501Â©3 in the state of North Carolina. Our tax identification number is 20-3410498. Your donations are tax-deductible, encrypted and safe.</p>
          <p>Now we humbly ask for your help. Will you consider becoming the cat's champion by making a gift today? Every little bit helps!.</p>
